# AI-Week5
# Predictive Modeling Projects – Agriculture & Healthcare
# Overview
This repository showcases two domain-specific machine learning projects:

Crop Yield Prediction: An SDG 2-aligned initiative using remote sensing and tabular farm data to forecast agricultural output.

Hospital Readmission Prediction: A healthcare AI system aimed at early identification of patients at risk of readmission within 30 days, with embedded fairness metrics and explainability tools.

Each project is structured according to CRISP-DM methodology and integrates MLOps, ethical safeguards, and stakeholder-driven features.

# Crop Yield Prediction (Parts 1)
Goal
Forecast crop yields based on soil quality, irrigation type, and historical harvest data to support food security initiatives.

Highlights
Data preprocessing using smoothing techniques and outlier detection

Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for robust prediction

Scalability focus with serverless deployment options

Concept drift mitigation through online learning algorithms

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, AWS Lambda

# Hospital Readmission Prediction (Parts 2–4)
Goal
Predict likelihood of 30-day patient readmission using EHR and social determinants data, while minimizing bias across demographic subgroups.

Highlights
Structured + unstructured data fusion (diagnosis codes + discharge notes)

NLP via pretrained models like ClinicalBERT

SHAP + LIME integration for model explainability

Bias auditing and class balance techniques (SMOTE, Fairlearn)

Compliance with HIPAA and integration-ready via API endpoints

Workflow includes feature engineering, model evaluation, ethical scoring

Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers, MLflow, Fairlearn, SHAP, LIME

# Ethics & Fairness
Projects embed fairness checkpoints at preprocessing and evaluation stages, using tools like:

IBM AI Fairness 360

Fairlearn (equalized odds post-processing)

Subgroup bias visualization (e.g., ROC by race/SES)

Explainability modules allow clinicians and stakeholders to interpret predictions confidently, supporting responsible adoption in care environments.
